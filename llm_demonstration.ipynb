      "**What is classical computing?**\n",
      "First, let's start with the familiar. Classical computers use \"bits\" to process information. Bits are either 0 or 1, like two buttons on your phone - one for yes and one for no. These bits follow deterministic rules, meaning that if you know the input, you can predict the output.\n",

      "**What is quantum computing?**\n",
      "Quantum computing uses \"qubits\" (quantum bits) instead of classical bits. Qubits are special because they can exist in multiple states at the same time, like being both 0 and 1 simultaneously! This property allows qubits to perform many calculations simultaneously, which is called a \"superposition.\"\n",

      "**How do qubits work?**\n",
      "Imagine you have a coin that can be either heads or tails. A classical bit would be either one or the other. But with a qubit, it's like having a special coin that can be both heads and tails at the same time! This means a qubit can process many possible outcomes simultaneously, making calculations much faster.\n",

      "Another key concept in quantum computing is \"entanglement.\" Imagine two toy cars connected by a spring. If you push one car, the other will move too, even if they're on opposite sides of the room. Qubits can be \"entangled\" like these toy cars, allowing them to communicate with each other instantly, no matter how far apart they are.\n",

      "To summarize:\n",

      "1. Classical computers use bits (0 or 1).\n",
      "2. Quantum computers use qubits, which can exist in multiple states at once.\n",
